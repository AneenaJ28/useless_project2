## Project Description
An interactive web application to explore the dynamic nature of emotions. Users can select a mood, instantly transforming the visual theme of the page with unique colors, animations, special effects, and custom cursors. It leverages the Google Gemini API to generate mood-appropriate quotes on demand.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The digital world is emotionally monotonous. Expressing a complex mood is often reduced to a single emoji. What if you want your entire digital space to *vibe* with how you feel? Why can't your browser have an existential crisis or a burst of pure joy on command?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the **Mood Swing Simulator**! This revolutionary app solves the non-problem of emotional blandness by allowing you to drench your screen in one of four core moods: Happy, Sad, Angry, or Genz. Get dynamic backgrounds, special effects, and bespoke AI-generated quotes to truly immerse yourself in an aesthetic. It's a vibe, no cap.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
#### For Software:
- **Languages:** TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React.js
- **API:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for quote generation.
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS for utility-first styling and custom CSS for animations.
- **Module Loading:** ES Modules via import maps (esm.sh).

#### For Hardware:
- This is a purely software-based web application and does not require any special hardware.

## Implementation
### For Software:
#### Installation
This project uses a modern, build-free setup with import maps. No `npm install` is required.
1.  **Clone/Download:** Get the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, etc.) onto your local machine.
2.  **API Key:** The application requires a Google Gemini API key. You must set this as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in the environment where you run your local server.
3.  **Local Server:** You need a simple local web server to serve the files. You can use any static file server. For example, using Python:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```

#### Run
1.  Start your local server from the project's root directory.
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
